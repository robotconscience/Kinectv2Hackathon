Kinectv2Hackathon
=================

Crap that @chrisallick and I made at the Kinectv2 Hackathon

Setup
=================
* Follow the guide in Joshua Noble / James George's Kinectv2 addons (right now we're using [https://github.com/obviousjim/ofxKinectV2](James') )
* Clone this into of/apps
* Weird one: you need to implement [https://github.com/sadmb/ofxKinectNui/issues/22](this fix) to run ofxLibwebsockets + ofxKinectv2
* Run at your own risk
